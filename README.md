Spaced mentions
===============

Spaced mentions is a simple [vanilla forums 2.1](http://vanillaforums.org/) plugin. 
It allows you to mention people with spaces in their name. 
`@Markus+Krogh` will be converted into `@Markus Krogh` when shown.

Along with the mentions it will change the username validation to accept spaces.

Other than that it supports the `#hashtag` and `/me metions himself`, just like the original vanilla forums comment engine.

Installation
-------------

To install just [download](https://github.com/mkrogh/SpacedMentions/archive/master.zip) and extract into your `/plugins` directory. 

TODO
----

- Better handling of username validation, curretly only requires username to start with a digit or character, but it can end with spaces...
